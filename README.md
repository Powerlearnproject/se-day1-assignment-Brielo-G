Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systemic application of engineering concepts, techniques, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products. It is imperative in the technology sector, enabling the development of software applications or systems powering large aspects of modern life, such as  communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. the development of programming languages such as  Fortran and C
2. The rise of agile methodologies
3. Establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design- This involves creating detailed designs of the user interface and sortware architecture
3. Implementation-Writing code and constructing software in accordance with design parameters.
4. Testing- Performing different tests to ensure the program fulfils quality standards and functional needs.
5. Deployment-Releasing the program to users or customers.
6. Maintenance- Following implementation, the program will get continuing enhancementsÂ or updates, and upgrades.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology involves a sequential approach with specific phases flowing downwards hence the name waterfall. These phases include requirements, design and implementation.  Agile on the other hand is a repetitive and incremental approach that places main focus on collaboration, adaptability and flexibility

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- writes code and implements software solutions
Quality assurance engeneer-Designing and Executing test plans to ensure software quality
Project manager- Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Software engineering tools enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code and has examples such as Viaual studio, eclipse Version Control Systems (VCS) are responsible for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples include Git and Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines-  Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Changing requirements-Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Technical doubt- Technical debt, which accumulates as a result of shortcuts or inadequate solutions, can inhibit future development efforts and increase maintenance expenses.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing-Testing individual components or modules of software
Intergration testing- Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing- Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user desire.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves cimposing queries in order to get the best possible responses from artificial intelligence models. It is important as it ensures that the questions are specific and clear in order for the AI to understand exactly what is needed.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt: "Tell me something about history."
effective prompt: " Tell me about historical events in Kenya in 1960."
The improved prompt is effective since it is more precise and specific about what part of history the AI should focus on
